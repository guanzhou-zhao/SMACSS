# Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS

## Prototyping

- Good programmers like patterns. Good Designers like pattern too.
- Patterns establish familiarity and encourage re-use.
- SMACSS is about identifying the patterns in your design and codifying them.

#### Prototype

- [ ] A prototype should assist in viewing components in part or in whole and allow codification of design language into building blocks.

- The web design industry likes reusable components and can be seen in many of the frameworks like **[Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)** (for a variety of site components) and [960.gs](http://960.gs/) (for layout grids).

#### My Own prototype

- It is advantageous to isolate your components into an easy-to-review format.
- **MailChimp, for example, has an internal cheat sheet of design patterns10
that they use to build the site. This documents various modules
that are used throughout the site and the code required for
each module.**

#### Remember

- Patterns are good.
- Codifying those patterns is also good.
- Having a process in place to review and test those patterns is great!...
